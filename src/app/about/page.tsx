      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Honey Provisions is a minimalist product formulation consultancy based in Austin, Texas. We specialize
        in developing natural health and wellness products that are as effective as they are cleanly crafted.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Our focus lies in working with herbal ingredients that are notoriously difficult to formulate or flavor.
        We have experience with compounds like <strong>kavalactones</strong>, <strong>cannabinoids</strong>,
        <strong> ashwagandha withanolides</strong>, <i><strong>Sceletium</strong></i> and <i><strong>Mitragyna</strong></i> <strong>alkaloids</strong> and a variety of adaptogens, nootropics, and traditional plant extracts.
        These actives demand a careful balance of solubility, bioavailability, and taste.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        We take a minimalist, scientific approach to every project â€” prioritizing transparency, clean labeling,
        and functional results. From the earliest product strategy conversations to the final flavor pass, our
        team collaborates closely with clients to create thoughtful, market-ready formulations.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        Whether you're creating a ready-to-drink beverage, capsule line, or modern twist on a traditional remedy,
        Honey Provisions brings deep herbal chemistry expertise and pragmatic formulation leadership to your team.
